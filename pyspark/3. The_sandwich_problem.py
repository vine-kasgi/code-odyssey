    Title: Sandwich Problem

    Question:

        Given a table NUM with the following schema:

        Column	|Type
        SN	    |INT
        NUMB	|INT

    This table contains a sequence of numbers with their serial number (SN) representing the order in which the numbers appear.

    Write a query to find all NUMB values that are "sandwiched" â€” i.e., a number that occurs more than once, and its first and last appearances have at least one different number in between (i.e., they are not adjacent).

    Return a result with a single column:

        NUMB
        -----
        4
        9
